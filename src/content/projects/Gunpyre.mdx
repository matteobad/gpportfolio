##### Gunpyre is an Isometric twin-stick shooter action game done following a vertical slice and scrum.

### Pre-Production

The first step has been the market analysis that had the Epic Megagrants as the main focus. 
Thanks to this step we were able to create a:  
    - Gym
    - [Pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v2LLS3LenwYsFTRMSHs8DkjZoeKpMo8z/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108645303739542320091&rtpof=true&sd=true)

After presenting it to our professors we were able to move forward to the production

#### Production - first ideas 

The first idea that we had tried to mix the action that we were looking for with a explorable map.

We liked how it was going with the combat so we tried to implement this kind of level by adding more rooms 
and more explorable paths.

After this build we decided to change the map because we were having trouble with the
blindspots that the kind of camera that we have was creating

---

### Production - definitive

In the end we decided to move towards a system of various rooms/arena that the player has 
to face in order to move to the next one.

#### Missing parts

Unfortunately due to some troubles with a few blueprints, we couldn't find the time to fix the boss. 
We are still working in order to bring it in the game and conclude the first biome for real. 

Except from this we are really happy with how the game came out, 
thank you very much for reading.
