#### The Town

Main focus for this area: - Making clear to the player of the gap between noble and poor with elevation and buildings - Should give asthethics of wonder and mystery

#### Meeting Cave

This area has been the hardest to build as it had to contain three main events and one of these includes
making the cave collapse.

The solution that i found in the end was hosting the two events that don’t need the cave
to collapse.

#### The old Mine

Main focus: - Making the access to this path only from the “Meeting cave”. - The other entrance is in the town but is blocked to give some foreshadowing. - It needs some challenge as it is a line that collapsed. - Needs a reward for undertaking this challenge.

### POST-MORTEM

##### The town:

Overall i’m pretty much satisfied with how the cave feels, probably i could build another mine line
if i had more time.

##### The “meeting cave”:

I could divide the revolutionary’s boss house area from the cave where the armies meet
to give more exploration opportunities.

##### The new mine:

This area is the part that i would change the most with the right time to do it, as i feel that it
doesn’t deliver the aesthethics of wonder and exploration, plus it could be feeling more realistic.

##### The old mine

Pretty happy with how it turned out, with more time i would love to make the path longer
and a bit more challenging in the end part.
