#### Pre-production

The main objective for this project was to create an area that would fit inside the already
existing environment of God of war.
In order to do so i’ve been studying the game through some documents such us:

- Setting
- LDD main

Thanks to the study done, i was able to make the layout using Figma where i tried to create
a circular exploration of the area in order to give knowledge of the place while exploring
and to surrise the player with hidden secrets.

#### Production

During the production of the blockout i focused on following as much as possible the layout in
terms of metrics and the overall idea while focusing on the vibes that the area had to give and
the rewards that the players expects when fully exploring the area.

The first challenge was to catch the player’s eye in order to make him choose to explore this
area instead of continuing the main path of the game.
The game already had this element, the waterfall.

For the entrance the answer was in a collectible located exactly inside the hole that the bridge
already had.

#### Landmarks

As i wanted to create a circular exploration pattern i wanted to make the player navigate thanks
to the aqueduct that functions as a landmark and as a connection between the two paths.

#### Hidden path

This has been one of the biggest challenges to make, i wanted a path that the player could
easily miss in the first place but it would appear so obvious after connecting to it with
the aqueduct or by walking back to the entrance of the cave.

What i came up with was to mislead the player’s eye with a crystal that needs to be lighten up
and to cover the climbable wall with some rocks.

#### Foreshadowing and rewards

Foreshadowing has always been one of my favourite parts of the games na di wanted to be
able to do so in my level too so, i used the waterfall to cover a treasure (yellow box)
that will only be visible from the Rune’s spot at the end of the main path.

This allowed me to keep the player’s attention up in order to not miss any explorable
part while making him see the whole map that he had just explored giving him aesthethics
such as:

- Exploration
- Accomplishment
- Wonder
