### Introduction

This project was made for a game jam in 2023. 
Topic : “Roots”
Time  : 1 week 
Role  : Level designer
Podium : 3rd place.

### Pre-Production

We have gone through several ideas until we decided to interpret the topic as “Going back to the roots” 
and we decided to mix it with another important topic such as “Pollution”. 

By associating these two topics with colors, we got to the idea of creating a black and white world (Polluted)
that regains its colors thanks to the collaboration of a plant and a robot, as there could be no more
humans in a world that much polluted.

After we got the idea, we started working on the mechanics: 
- Shooting 
- Coloring the world 
- Charge the plant with sunlight 
- Defend the plant while it colors the area

#### Structural needs:

- Places where to plant the flower
- Sun spots where to charge the plant 
- Affordance for the player of where these spots are

### Landmarks

To give affordance and sense of orientation, we designed the map with 5 different landmarks:

4 at the corners and 1 at the center.
