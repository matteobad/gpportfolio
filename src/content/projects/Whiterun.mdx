### Introduction

This  project has mainly been an exercise to make me practice more blockouts and, 
which better map than the one I’ve been playing the most during all my life? 

Whiterun for me has been more than just a map as I’ve spent more time in this single town 
than every other game that I’ve ever played. 

I’ve been studying every aspect of Whiterun in order to recreate it as similar as possible, 
while I was trying to reach the level of polishness and detail needed in the industry.

### Pre-Production

The first step was finding a layout online from which i could study better the town it self.

After finding the layout, i’ve been calculating every road’s lenght that the town has by using 
as metrics the in-game steps and the character’s height as a reference for calculating 
how high the buildings were. 

---

### Production

After gaining all the info that i needed, i followed these steps to start making the town:

    - Ignore the landscape until the very end 
    - Build the roads and stairs
    - Build the houses 
    - Build the palace 
    - Raise the landscape 
    - Color coding and text render for better understanding of the level’s spaces 

#### Build the roads

This has been the most challenging part of the prject as i had to start from a blank map, 
but i needed the roads to understand better the house’s locations and all the others spaces. 

The first road that i focused on was the main one that connects the town’s entrance to 
the market square and from there i moved towards the castel. 

After building the main road, all the others were really easy to connect to it.

#### Build the houses

For the houses i created one for the most common houses that i’ve copied several times 
to save time.

For the main buildings such as: 

    - Vendors 
    - Taverns 
    - Temple
    - Secondary quest’s buildings
    - Player’s house 

I’ve been investing a bit more time to recreate a blockout version that could give feedbacks on 
how the buildings should look like.

#### Building Dragonsreach 

The palace was the part that i wanted to recreate in the most accurate way possible. 

I’ve been using the character’s steps and height as a metric reference and, thanks to the
possibility to use cheat codes in skyrim, i was able to fly around the palace and take pretty 
accurate references. 

Overall i’m really happy on how it feels and looks, i didn’t focus on the details such as stairs
at the top of the building because i wasn’t making the interior and i would have never 
reached that part of the building.

#### Raise the landscape 

This has been left as one of the latest steps in the process because i wanted to have the stairs 
as a reference for how high i had to go with the landscape. 

Thanks to the work done before, it has been really easy to raise the ground to the right height.

#### Color coding

As i wanted to reach a nice polishness and detail with this blockout, i focused on finding a way
to make the color coding work correctly in helping the others to understand everything that was
needed to know. 

The perfect answer has been mixing the color coding of the buildings, with the real color that 
the house’s parts should really have.

### Post-mortem

I’m really happy on how the level came out and i think i’ve been growing a lot as a level designer 
as i needed to understand lots of details (metrics, utilization of space and readablitily of the 
level’s bioms), that i would have never been studying without starting from an existing level. 

If you want to try the build i leave here a link to download it, [Build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DAUrzZYE3rbkFRwKqqeVUvrRE_d6T8SZ/view?usp=sharing)
